Concord High School has a problem: while various high-achieving students want to take AP Chemistry, others find it too difficult and consequently avoid enrolling. Even those who do join the class often leave due to its high workload and complexity
Currently, 40 students want to take the class, and 10 others are considering it.
From previous years, it has been determined that of those taking the course every day, 90% continue to take it the next day, while 10% switch out. Of those who switched out, 20% will reevaluate and rejoin the class, while 80% will enroll in easier courses, such as Honours Chemistry.
For a class to be offered, it must have at least 15 students over a one-month period in September. Will the course remain after this period, and if so, how many students will it have?
